# CS300_App
This course tasked students with leveraging software engineering fundamentals. All other projects were monolithic and tightly coupled (not to be redundant), and I wanted to explore a more modular approach that would motivate different web technology solutions that have emerged over the last 15 years. 
In order to give myself a challenge, I tried my hand at developing a microservice oriented architecture I would emulate over sockets. The majority of this project involved creating abstractions to handle interservice communication, with uniform protocols for making rest endpoints more user friendly, while making each service robust and concentrated in its own right. 
There is a central Repo of declared services that is a master service discovery of sorts. This emerged as a natural solution during construction, as otherwise services would exist without any knowledge of other services. The first thing a new service was tasked to achieve was announcing its health to this orchestrator, which would then register it in a mapping of services to port numbers and a payload of an API mapping the rest endpoints, to be used in self generating a client for another service.
